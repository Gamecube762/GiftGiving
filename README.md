About
-----
This is just a plugin idea I had from the holiday season. This plugin lets players give gifts to other players who can then open them when its unlocked by the server. Presents can be unlocked by the set date in the config.yml or can be unlocked from an admin.

This plugin has the [AutoUpdater2.0]:https://forums.bukkit.org/threads/updater-2-0-easy-safe-and-policy-compliant-auto-updating-for-your-plugins-new.96681/ from Gravity.
This plugin also has [MetricsStats]:http://mcstats.org/

What you can do
---------------
Feel free to Fork and add your own features.
Create a PR with new features and I can add them to the main plugin!

To DO:
------
* Fix players from taking stuff from other's gifts
* Make the UnlockDate useable
* Add MySQL support
* Add onto this list
